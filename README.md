### Project Status Update

Desktop Version
I have successfully implemented the desktop version of the project. Due to a high volume of tasks and commitments during this week, I was unable to start work on the mobile site. However, to ensure timely progress, I have extended my working hours, often working late into the night (until 4 am) as evidenced by the timestamps on my commits.

### Note on Mobile Site Development
The development of the mobile version has not yet begun, reflecting the prioritization of the desktop implementation under current time constraints.
